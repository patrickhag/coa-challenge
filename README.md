## Project README

### Overview

This repo consist of an interactive image gallery using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes basic styling and interactive features. Due to browser-specific behavior, you may notice that hover interactions might not respond on small screens when using Google Chrome. For a better experience, I recommended to use Mozilla Firefox for testing hover interactions and opacity feature on small screens.

### Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and folders:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file responsible for styling the HTML elements.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the interactive logic of the web page.
- `images`: This folder contains the project images
- `challenges`: This folder contains coding questions of the challenge, you may run those questions using node runtime environment or your console in browser.
